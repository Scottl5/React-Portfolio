      <p id="about-description">
        I attended college at Southern New Hampshire University and graduated in
        2019 with a Bachelor of Science in Sports Management. After graduation,
        I was considering if I wanted a career with my degree, and after
        consideration, I decided against it. I realized that coding is something
        I wanted to learn so I enrolled in a six month course that covered
        full-stack development.Throughout the course, I practiced using HTML,
        CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Sequelize, Mongoose, and React. As
        the course went on, I realized that I enjoyed backend development more.
        I hope to refine my coding skills as I go on in my coding career and
        secure a job as a web developer.
